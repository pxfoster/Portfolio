					<h4>Clicking Game</h4>
					<p>[Unity] A project I made for the Junior Programmer pathway for Unity.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					I made this game for my final project of the Junior Programmer pathway from Unity Learn. The objective of the game is to get a high score.
					The good orbs give points and the bad orbs take them away. If the player misses a click, they get a missed orb at the top of the screen.
					It is game over if the player misses five times. There are also different difficulty settings and each difficulty has it's own high score
					list. The high score lists are saved to a json file.

				<p>
					One of my first games I ever made on my own was an asteroids clone. The language I used was C++ and
					I used OpenGL for the graphics. Since I had to think of a game to make while going through one of
					the Unity learning pathways, I decided that I wanted to make this game again in Unity this time.

					<h4>Brick Breaker</h4>

					This is a game I enjoyed playing as a kid and I also enjoyed making it, along with Pong, while I
					was learning C++. The purpose of this program was to have a counter, so I decided to count down
					how many bricks were left. Even though it is very simple, I still enjoyed making it.

					<h4>Space Pachinko</h4>
					<p>[Unity] A minigame from the Unity Essentials learning pathway.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					This was the first minigame I made while learning Unity. The task was from the Unity Essentials
					learning pathway. The task was to learn about rigid bodies and collisions, so I was supposed to
					have a ball fall down and bounce around some pegs. I decided to turn this into more of a game
					where the ball moves around and the player has to choose a horizontal and vertical position to
					drop the ball. Although this task only required having the ball drop, I enjoyed taking the time
					to add input and sound effects.

					<h4>Simple Task Manager</h4>
					<p>[C++] Just for fun.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					This program I made just for fun and to practice C++. I thought a task manager would be a good
					way to practice C++ and file handling. Even though the menu system might seem a little odd to
					navigate, especially changing the file name before saving and loading the file, I grew fond of
					how it turned it. The program has input validation and I also made my own date data structure
					which has its own validation.

					the program then merges the two linked lists together while sorting the numbers.

					certain settings which are stored in a file. The settings that can be changed are the number of
					digits for each number and if subtracion can use negative numbers.

					<h4>Rogue Game</h4>
					<p>[C++] A project I was working on as a hobby.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					This was one of my more enjoyable projects that I worked on as a hobby. I used the SFML library along with C++ to build it. One of my favorite
					game series is the Ultima series. Ultima 7 in particular is what inspired me to try to make a similar game because not only was it the first
					game of the series I played, but it really felt like a living world to me. I especially liked the inventory system because the items weren't
					placed in a grid, instead, they were able to be moved around in the inventory so you could sort the items however you wanted. The inventory
					system was one of my main focuses on this project and I think I was able to accomplish it pretty well. Unfortunately, I was never able to fully
					complete the project because since this was just a hobby, other things took priority. I would like to eventually try this project again.
					<br /><br />
					Besides the inventory system, other features I had worked on were a map editor, day-night cycle, stat system with a stat menu, a basic enemy
					AI that would follow and attack the player if they came near, and a scripting system that would make the characters automatically move to
					a certain position if a trigger was hit. The inventory also checked for the player's distance to the item so the item couldn't be grabbed
					from anywhere on the screen.
